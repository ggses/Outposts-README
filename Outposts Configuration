# Configuration Notes and Best Practices:
# 
# 1. Naming Conventions:
#    - All outpost names must be unique across the server
#    - Region names should follow the pattern "outpost_<name>" for consistency
#    - Use descriptive names that players will recognize
#
# 2. Balance Considerations:
#    - Longer capture times should have better rewards
#    - Longer cooldowns should be paired with more valuable loot
#    - Consider server population when setting cooldown times
#
# 3. Loot Configuration:
#    - Chances are percentages (0-100), not decimals
#    - Invalid materials will be skipped without breaking the plugin
#    - ItemsAdder items require the plugin to be installed
#    - Test loot configurations on a development server first
#
# 4. Mob Waves:
#    - Mob format is "MOB_TYPE:COUNT" (e.g., "ZOMBIE:5")
#    - Multiple waves can trigger at the same percentage
#    - Sentinel mobs require the Sentinel plugin
#    - Consider spawn radius when designing wave encounters
#
# 5. Map Integration:
#    - Requires respective plugins (BlueMap/Dynmap) to be installed
#    - Icons depend on the map plugin's available icon set
#    - Colors use standard hex format (#RRGGBB)
#    - Test markers after configuration changes
#
# 6. Performance Tips:
#    - Avoid too many simultaneous waves with large mob counts
#    - Large spawn radius can impact performance with many mobs
#    - Consider server TPS when designing complex encounters
#
# 7. Color Codes:
#    - Use & symbol for color codes (e.g., &6 for gold, &c for red)
#    - Formatting codes: &l (bold), &n (underline), &o (italic), &k (magic)
#    - Reset formatting with &r
#
# 8. Maintenance:
#    - Regularly backup this configuration file
#    - Test changes on a development server first
#    - Monitor server logs for configuration errors
#    - Use /oup reload after making changes
