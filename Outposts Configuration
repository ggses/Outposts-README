# Outposts Configuration File
# Define individual outposts here
# Each outpost must have a unique name and corresponding WorldGuard region

# Example outpost configuration (remove this section when creating real outposts)
# This serves as a template showing all available configuration options
example-outpost:
  # WorldGuard region name associated with this outpost
  # This region will be created automatically when using /oup create command
  region: "outpost_example"

  # Display name shown in messages, boss bars, and UI elements
  # Supports color codes using & (e.g., &6Gold &cRed)
  displayName: "Example Outpost"

  # Time in seconds required to capture this outpost (overrides global default)
  # Players must stay in the region for this duration to complete capture
  captureTime: 60

  # Cooldown in seconds after capture before outpost becomes available again
  # During cooldown, the outpost cannot be attacked
  cooldown: 300

  # Whether to show notification when players enter this outpost region
  # If enabled, players will see a message when entering the outpost area

# Configuration Notes:
# - All outpost names must be unique
# - Region names should follow the pattern "outpost_<name>"
# - Capture times and cooldowns are in seconds
# - Loot chances are percentages (0-100)
# - Invalid materials will be skipped without breaking the plugin
# - Mob format is "MOB_TYPE:COUNT" (e.g., "ZOMBIE:5")
# - Map integration requires the respective plugins to be installed
# - Color codes in display names use & symbol (e.g., &6 for gold, &c for red)
# - Chest location is set automatically when you place the outpost chest
